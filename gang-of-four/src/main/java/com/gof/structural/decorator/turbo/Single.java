/**
 * The type Single.
 * Single turbochargers alone have limitless variability.
 * Differing the compressor wheel size and turbine will lead to completely different torque characteristics.
 * Large turbos will bring on high top-end power, but smaller turbos will provide better low-end grunt as they spool faster.
 * There are also ball bearing and journal bearing single turbos.
 * Ball bearings provide less friction for the compressor and turbine to spin on, thus are faster to spool (while adding cost).
